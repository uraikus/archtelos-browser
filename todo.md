# Roadmap

Open work and deliberate non-work. Everything here is future tense on
purpose; every other document except changelog.md and benchmarks.md
describes the present (CLAUDE.md, §3).

## CSS: move to the 2026 snapshot

Where the engine stands against
**[CSS Snapshot 2026](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2026/)** is measured,
specification by specification, in [css-2026.md](css-2026.md). The
snapshot's official definition of CSS is 24 specifications; the engine
implements no part of 8 of them. That list, not a sense of what feels
modern, sets the order below.

### The cascade

The seven conformance bugs are fixed: specificity is compared as a
triple, importance inverts the origin order, `inherit` takes the
parent's computed value, `@supports` evaluates its condition,
`text-decoration` and `opacity` no longer inherit, `rem` and `vh`
resolve against the real root font size and viewport, and an unparseable
selector drops its whole rule. What is left of CSS Cascade 4:

1. **`revert`**, which rolls a property back to the value the previous
   cascade origin gave. It behaves as `unset` today because the origins
   are not kept apart once the cascade has run; doing it properly means
   keeping a per-origin computed value, or recomputing with the author
   declarations removed.
2. **`all`**, which sets every property at once to a CSS-wide keyword.

### Then the official definition, largest holes first

1. **What is left of the CSS2 chapters**: `overflow: scroll` and
   `auto`, which need a scrollable area rather than only a clip, and
   paged media (§13). Positioning (§9.3), floats (§9.5), generated
   content (§12) and `overflow: hidden` clipping (§11) are done.
2. **What is left of Flexible Box 1**: `flex-basis: content`, the
   min-content floor that keeps an item from shrinking below its own
   content, and nested flex containers as flex items. `flex-wrap`,
   `align-content`, `baseline` alignment and auto margins are done.
3. **`::first-line`**, and the `url()` in `content` that would let
   generated content carry an image. `::first-letter` is done, and
   `::before` and `::after` generate boxes from strings, `attr()`,
   `counter()`, `counters()` and the four quote keywords. `::first-line`
   is the harder half: the line it names does not exist until line
   breaking has run, so restyling it means breaking the line twice or
   re-breaking after the style changes the metrics.

   None of this is gradeable by the selector instrument -- a
   pseudo-element selects part of an element rather than an element, so
   `querySelectorAll` has no answer to compare against -- nor by the
   property instrument, which cannot see `counter-reset`,
   `counter-increment` or `quotes` because Chromium does not enumerate
   them on a computed style. It is measured by geometry and by the
   generated text, as tests/unit/test_counters.f and tests/unit/test_quotes.f do.
4. **CSS Images 3, completed**: `conic-gradient()`, gradient
   interpolation hints, and the one degenerate case left — an ellipse
   with zero height and non-zero width, which the standard renders as a
   mirrored linear gradient and this renders as the last stop, the same
   as every other degenerate shape. Linear and radial gradients,
   `object-fit` and `object-position` are done.

   **Headless Chromium cannot supply pixel ground truth in this
   container**, which is what anything graded in pixels rather than
   geometry has to work around: `--screenshot` paints only the first
   scanline of the page. A plain 40x40 block of flat colour comes back
   as one row of colour and 39 rows of white, with or without
   `--virtual-time-budget`, so it is the screenshot pipeline rather than
   anything about images. `tests/chromium.py` is unaffected because it
   reads the DOM rather than pixels. `object-fit` and `object-position`
   were graded against the specification's own sizing algorithm instead,
   which is exact; `tests/render/objectfit.f` derives every expectation
   from the intrinsic size and the box and states the derivation beside
   the check. A radial gradient can be graded the same way.
5. **Backgrounds and Borders 3, completed**: more than one background
   layer per box; `border-image-repeat`'s
   `round` and `space`, which fit the last tile rather than cutting it;
   a blurred
   shadow whose falloff is a real Gaussian rather than the accumulated
   alpha of nested rectangles the canvas's lack of a blur forces. A
   single background image from `url()` with `repeat`,
   `position`, `size`, `origin` and `clip` is done, and so is every border
   style, per side, and a radius on each corner separately. A
   `border-radius` in a percentage, and the elliptical `/` form that
   gives a corner two radii, are still to do: both need the painter's
   corner arc to take a pair of radii rather than one. A background
   clipped to the padding or
   content edge still uses the border box's `border-radius` rather than
   the smaller inner curve, which needs the rounded-rectangle path that
   an image layer does not have (FINDINGS.md, "an image is a drawable
   surface with a smaller API").
6. **Fonts 3**, which is **blocked on Festina rather than on effort**: a
   numeric `font-weight` has nowhere to go, because the runtime stores
   the weight in a two-valued Cairo enum and decides it by searching the
   style string for `bold`; and `@font-face` cannot be done at all,
   because `cairo_select_font_face` picks a family from the system and
   no call loads a font file. FINDINGS.md has the measurements and
   festina.md §3l the proposal. Until Festina grows either, the most
   this item can gain is `font-variant` and `font-stretch`, which are
   the parts that do not need a font the system lacks.
7. **Counter Styles 3, completed**: the `range`, `fallback` and
   `speak-as` descriptors; the `symbols()` function; and the predefined
   styles that need a table this repository would have to vendor --
   `hebrew`, `armenian`, `georgian` and the East Asian ones beyond
   `cjk-decimal`. What is left of Lists 3 is `list-style-image`, which
   needs a fetched image for the marker.
8. **Transforms 1, completed**: a transformed box should establish a
   stacking context and a containing block for its positioned
   descendants, and hit testing should use the inverse transform so a
   click lands where the box is drawn rather than where it was laid
   out. `skew()` and `matrix()` are blocked on Festina rather than on
   effort: the canvas has no call that takes a matrix (FINDINGS.md,
   finding 33, festina.md §3n).
9. **Containment 1, completed**: layout and style containment are
   computed and change nothing, because nothing escapes a box that way
   yet — there is no counter or quote scope to cut, and a float does
   not leave its formatting context because none is established.
   `content-visibility: auto` needs to know what is on screen.
10. **Compositing and Blending 1 is blocked on Festina**, like Fonts 3:
   `mix-blend-mode`, `isolation` and `background-blend-mode` all need a
   compositing operator, and the runtime sets `CAIRO_OPERATOR_SOURCE`
   everywhere with no call to change it. Cairo has every Porter-Duff
   and separable blend operator; the entry point is what is missing.
11. **Grid, completed**: named lines and `grid-template-areas`,
    `minmax()`, `min-content`, `max-content` and `fit-content()`,
    `auto-fill` and `auto-fit`, dense packing, and subgrid. An `auto`
    track is sized by the largest item that sits in it alone, so an
    item spanning two auto tracks does not grow either of them.
12. **Multi-column 1, completed**: `column-fill: auto`; a spanner that
    sits below the container's own children, which needs its ancestors
    broken around it; and real fragment boxes, so that a subtree nested
    below those children can be broken and a split child's background
    paints in each column rather than only the first. Fragment boxes are what
    Fragmentation 3 still wants too: `break-before` and `break-after`
    decide where a column breaks, but a break can only fall between
    the container's own children or between one child's lines, so
    `break-inside: avoid` on a grandchild changes nothing, and
    `box-decoration-break` has no two boxes to choose between. That is
    one piece of work for paged media as well.
13. The remainder of the official definition, lower value for this
   renderer but still part of the definition: Basic User Interface 3's
   `cursor`, `resize` and `appearance`, which need window APIs Festina
   does not expose, and Easing 1, which describes the timing functions
   of transitions and animations and needs a clock and a repaint loop
   rather than a property.
14. **Writing Modes 3, completed**: `writing-mode` and
    `text-orientation`, which need a second layout axis rather than a
    property; the explicit embedding and isolate codes (the X rules of
    UAX #9) and the `unicode-bidi` values that use them; reordering
    across two inline boxes on one line rather than within each; and
    Arabic shaping, which needs contextual forms the toy font API does
    not offer (FINDINGS.md, finding 31).

### After the official definition

`@layer` ordering, which is discarded today (Cascade 5); the
Media Queries 4 range syntax; Color 5 entirely — `color-mix()` and the
relative colour syntax; the gamut mapping Color 4 asks for, since a
colour outside sRGB is clamped per channel here; `inline-table`, which lays out
as a block-level table rather than an inline one (Display 3), and that
level's two-value syntax; what is left of Text 3 — `line-break`, which is about
CJK, and `text-wrap-style: balance`, which needs the line breaker run
more than once — and what is left of Text Decoration 3:
`text-decoration-skip-ink`, which needs the glyph outlines Festina does
not expose; an emphasis mark that reserves space in the line rather than
falling outside it; and a `wavy` underline drawn as a curve rather than
as stepped segments, which needs the path API an image does not have.
What is left of Shapes 1: `shape-image-threshold`, which needs a shape
read out of an image's alpha channel, and the round outset
`shape-margin` asks for on a polygon, which is a square one here.
What is left of Masking 1: the masks themselves — `mask` and its seven
longhands, `mask-type` and `clip-rule` — and `inset()`'s `round`
radius, both of which want the path API too; and a `clip-path` inside
another clipped subtree, which does not clip again, the same limit
`overflow: hidden` has here.
These sit in the
snapshot's three lower classes, which is lower than their prominence
suggests.

**`overflow-clip-margin` needs its meaning pinned down before it is
worth implementing.** It was written far enough to register on the
property instrument and then removed: on a box 60px wide with a 10px
border and `overflow: clip`, Chromium keeps a child's pixel 75px from
the border box's left edge, which the padding box (which ends at 70)
does not contain and the border box (which ends at 80) does. With
`overflow-clip-margin: 20px` the same probe puts the edge at 90, which
is the padding box plus the margin and not the border box plus it. The
two readings disagree by a border width, and a property whose meaning is
not settled is not one to ship for the sake of a count. The probe is
`document.elementFromPoint` at each pixel's centre, which is how
`clip-path`'s own expectations were read.

### The instrument

**Three measurements exist**, each with a floor in `tests/run.sh`:
`tests/conformance/properties.f` reports how many of the 369 CSS
properties the instrument can grade change what this engine renders
(186; Chromium reports 373, and four of them cannot be graded by a probe
that is an ordinary element),
`tests/conformance/elements.f` how many of the 122 HTML elements get
the default `display` Chromium gives them (122 of 122), and
`tests/conformance/selectors.f` how many of 61 selectors match the same
elements as Chromium (61). Most entries in the work above should move
the first number, and the runner names every property that still does
nothing. Some cannot: CSS Color 4's colour spaces are a value syntax,
and the instrument asks only whether `color` changes the computed
style, so `tests/unit/test_color4.f` is what grades them.

**Find a CSS conformance corpus.** The HTML parser went from 20% to 93%
against the standard's own tests, level with Chromium, and the only
reason that was possible is that a corpus existed and could be run.
`css/` in web-platform-tests is the equivalent, and the first question
is how much of it runs without script, since the reference-comparison
harness assumes a scripting browser. A pixel comparison against Chromium
on a fixed page set, both already wired up in `tests/chromium.py`, may be
the more practical instrument.

**Re-checking the snapshot needs it supplied.** `www.w3.org` is refused
by this network's egress policy, so a session cannot fetch the document
itself; it has to be handed in.

## HTML: the remaining conformance gap

1,535 of 1,652 tree-construction cases pass, which is what Chromium
passes on the same corpus. Of the 117 failures, 84 are cases Chromium
fails too. The rest, largest first:

- **`tests16.dat`** (11 cases). Script-data tokenizer corners, mostly
  around `<!--` inside a script element and the escaped states.
- **`tests26.dat`** (5) and **`tests1.dat`** (5), **`tests2.dat`** (4),
  **`tests19.dat`** (2): a different small rule each, mostly formatting
  elements interacting with tables and with `<nobr>`.
- **Foreign content corners** (`namespace-sensitivity.dat`,
  `html5test-com.dat`, one case each): breaking out of SVG and MathML
  when an HTML block tag arrives in a namespace-sensitive position.
- **Adoption agency corners** (`adoption01.dat`, `adoption02.dat`,
  `tests6.dat`, `tables01.dat`, one each).
- **Fragment parsing** (195 cases, currently skipped). `innerHTML`
  parsing needs the fragment algorithm and a context element. Nothing
  in the renderer needs it, but it is the single largest block of
  skipped tests.
- **NUL bytes in input** (98 cases, currently skipped). A Festina `text`
  cannot hold a NUL at all, so these cannot run without moving the
  tokenizer onto a byte buffer. See festina.md.
- **Scripted tests** (14 cases, permanently skipped). There is no
  JavaScript engine and there will not be one.

**`processing-instructions.dat` is deliberately not implemented.** The
corpus expects `<?x>` to build a processing-instruction node; the
tokenizer's bogus-comment state builds a comment, and so does Chromium,
which was checked directly. Whichever is right, matching the corpus here
would mean disagreeing with every shipping engine. Revisit when the
standard's text is reachable.

**Where this browser is ahead of Chromium** it is mostly configuration
rather than quality: `noscript01.dat` assumes a disabled scripting flag,
which is permanently true here. `webkit02.dat` and three other files are
genuine leads.

## A margin that collapses through to the root is dropped

`<body style="margin:0"><div style="margin-top:40px">` puts the div at
the very top. Chromium puts it at 40, and says so:
`getBoundingClientRect().top` is 40 there and 0 here.

`layoutDocument` computes the margin collapsing into the root and never
applies it, because applying it at the root double-counts the ordinary
case where `layoutBlock` already has. The fix is to separate the margin
that collapses *through* the root from the one that collapses *into* it.
Found while testing absolute positioning, which resolves against the
ancestor's border box and so depends on it.

## Layout

The layout engine handles normal flow well and does not attempt the
rest. In rough order of how often real pages need it:

- **Block formatting contexts.** A float belongs to one and cannot
  escape it; there is a single float list for the document instead, so
  `overflow: hidden` or an inline-block does not contain a float, and a
  float does not grow the parent that holds it.
- **`position: sticky`**, which computes as `relative` because nothing
  in layout knows the scroll offset.
- **Grid**, which still falls back to block layout.
- **Sub-pixel layout.** Every length is an integer, so three items
  sharing 400px are 133, 134 and 133 where a browser keeps 133.33 and
  rounds only when painting. Distributing free space by rounding the
  running total rather than each share puts the *edges* in the right
  place, which is what the flex code now does, but an isolated width can
  still be a pixel off.
- **Vertical writing modes**, **multi-column**, **`aspect-ratio`**.

## Networking is blocked on two Festina bugs

Neither is a design decision and neither has a workaround in this
repository. Both are written up in FINDINGS.md with minimal
reproductions and proposed in festina.md.

1. **An HTTP response over 64 KiB takes thirty seconds.** The runtime's
   client reads to EOF rather than to `Content-Length`, and a keep-alive
   server never sends EOF, so the read ends when the 30 second socket
   timeout fires. The bytes are correct; only the wait is wrong. Most
   real pages are over 64 KiB, so this is the single thing standing
   between this browser and the live web. `tests/latencyserver.py`
   serves under the limit to keep the preload benchmark measuring
   prefetching instead of this.
2. **The query string is dropped from every request.** `GET /page?a=1`
   goes out as `GET /page`, with `req.code` 200 and `req.url`
   unchanged, so nothing can detect it. Half the web is behind a query
   string and the URL is the only input `send()` takes.

Until the first is fixed there is no honest end-to-end benchmark against
a real site, and the numbers in benchmarks.md are all local files or a
local server.

## Networking, once it is unblocked

- **Prefetch across a navigation, not only within one.** The preload
  scanner's cache is cleared at the start of every load, so a resource
  shared by two pages is fetched twice. A cache keyed by URL with the
  response's own validators would fix it, and would need the
  conditional-request headers the fetch layer does not send yet.
- **Teach the scanner `media`.** `gatherStylesheets` skips a
  `<link rel=stylesheet media=print>`; the scanner does not, so one gets
  prefetched and thrown away. That is a request nobody wanted, which is
  the one kind of mistake a scanner is not allowed to make. Evaluating
  the query needs `evaluateMediaQuery`, which lives in the CSS layer,
  and `src/net/` does not import the CSS layer — so this is a layering
  question before it is a code one.
- **Let a worker fetch a local file.** A preload worker speaks HTTP and
  nothing else, so a `file://` page dispatches nothing. That is the
  right trade today, because a local read is microseconds, but it makes
  the scanner untestable without a server.
- **Follow redirects on a worker.** A worker cannot call `resolveUrl`
  (a thread body may not call a top-level function, FINDINGS.md), so a
  prefetch that redirects is abandoned and refetched on the main thread.
  Correct, and one round trip wasted.

## Performance

Chromium parses, styles and lays out the 51 KB page about **four times
faster** — 24.9 ms against 98 — with both sides measured from inside and
start-up outside the timer (benchmarks.md). The cascade and layout are
93% of our time and all of the gap, and **layout is the larger half
of the two**. In order:

- **Collecting and applying declarations, now that computing them is
  cheap.** Matching is 12 ms and applying 14 ms of a 35 ms cascade, and
  both are still paid per element: 8,578 selector tests and 11,614
  declarations applied into a fresh map. The same insight that made
  computing cheap applies again — an element whose matched rule set is
  identical to a sibling's could share the merged declaration map too,
  and then the whole cascade would be paid once per distinct style
  rather than once per element.
- **Read the declarations an element has, rather than asking for every
  property it might have.** `computeStyle` looks up about 73 named
  properties per element and 83% of them find nothing. This matters much
  less now that a distinct style is computed only 24 times on the
  benchmark page, but it is still the shape that keeps the phase flat as
  more properties land.
- **An angled gradient is painted a rectangle per band per row**, which
  is 14 ms for sixty boxes where an axis-aligned one is 1 ms
  (benchmarks.md). Rendering the gradient once into an offscreen image
  and drawing that image would make the angle free; `blankImage` and
  image drawing exist, so this needs no new language feature.
- **Give the vectorizer a loop it can take.** LLVM autovectorizes
  Festina's IR and reaches almost none of this browser's hot loops:
  `paintLinearGradient` gets 14 packed operations against 45 scalar
  ones, `asciiIndexOf` and `cascadeMatches` get none, because they exit
  early or chase pointers (benchmarks.md). The gradient row fill is the
  one that could plainly be rewritten branch-free over a row of pixels,
  and it is the same rewrite the offscreen-image item above wants.
- **Layout, which is now the bigger half.** 48 ms against the cascade's
  28: building the box tree is 14 ms, placing text 12, measuring it 9.
  The box tree is rebuilt from scratch on every relayout even when only
  the viewport width changed.
- **Four of those 93 ms are the preload scanner's worker threads**, on a
  page that prefetches nothing: glibc's `malloc` abandons its
  single-threaded fast path at the first `pthread_create` and never
  takes it back, and Festina allocates on almost every operation
  (FINDINGS.md). Festina cannot create a thread on demand, so this is
  not fixable here — festina.md proposes the lazy start that would fix
  it, and until then it is the one place this project breaks its own
  rule that a feature must not cost the pages that do not use it.
- **A string interner.** A large share of both phases is comparing and
  hashing tag, class and property names that could be integers. This
  wants language support to be worth it; see festina.md.

**Do not compare unequal canvases again.** PNG encoding is linear in
pixels and dominates at this page size: the same page onto 800x8000
instead of 800x600 costs 336 ms instead of 120 ms, and all of that
difference is encoding. `tests/bench.sh` pins both engines to 800x600.

## Deliberate non-work

- **Playing audio.** `<audio>` lays out and draws its controls, and it
  does not play. Festina has real audio — `aud`, `.play()`, `.stop()`,
  `.isPlaying()` — but using it links ALSA and libmpg123, and Festina
  links them dynamically, so the produced binary would carry
  `libasound.so.2` and `libmpg123.so.0` as runtime `NEEDED` entries the
  way it already carries `libcairo.so.2`. A browser that cannot start on
  a machine without a sound library is a worse browser, and this is two
  new system dependencies rather than one. festina.md proposes the fix:
  open the audio device lazily, so a program that merely *can* play
  audio does not hard-require the library to start.

- **JavaScript.** Out of scope permanently. It is a second language
  implementation, not a renderer feature, and its absence is what makes
  the scripting flag simple.
- **Networking beyond HTTP(S) GET.** No cookies, no cache, no
  compression negotiation. The fetch layer exists to feed the renderer.
- **Forms that submit**, file uploads, drag and drop.
- **Incremental rendering.** Pages are parsed, laid out and painted in
  full. Streaming layout would complicate every phase for a benefit
  that only shows on slow networks.
- **Benchmarks in CI.** The suite runs on every pull request; the
  benchmarks do not. A shared runner with unknown neighbours measures
  the neighbours, and a timing gate that fires at random teaches people
  to ignore it. `tests/bench.sh` is run deliberately, on one machine,
  with the result written into benchmarks.md.
